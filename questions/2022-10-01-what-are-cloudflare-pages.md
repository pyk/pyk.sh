[Cloudflare Pages][1] is a platform for frontend developers to deploy static
and dynamic web application.

Any [Static Site Generator][2] such as [Eleventy][3] can be deployed to
Cloudflare Pages. With cloudflare pages you don’t need to worry about managing
and monitoring server. You will get globally distributed server via easy
deployment. Your web application will very fast since it’s deployed close to
your users.

If you want to build dynamic web application you can directly write Cloudflare
Pages function to handle the HTTP request. Cloudflare Pages Functions enable
you to run server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a
dedicated server. With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as
authenticating, querying databases, handling form submissions, or working with
middleware. You can also use [Full Stack Web Framework][4] like [Remix][5] to
write fast web application.

Cloudflare Pages is a complete platform that lets you focus on the user
interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and
resilient user experience.
