[Chakra UI][1] is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives
you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

One of the hardest part of building web app is to build an interactive and
accessible web app. Chakra UI is a component library that helps you to build
interactive and accessible web app in no time and lets you focus on your app
content and logic.

There are a various interactive components that you can use directly such as a
Modal and Toast. Implementing these interactive components manually is tedious
task and error-prone. In Chakra UI this is just simple as importing the
component.
