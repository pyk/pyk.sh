Full Stack Web Framework is a framework that helps you to write complete web
application: from backend to frontend. Backend is a program that run in the
server and frontend is a program that runs in the web browser.

As a web Application developer, you need to write two programs:

1. **Backend program** that runs in the server to handle all business logic
   such as user authentication, user authorization and user data management in
   your web application
2. **Frontend program** that runs in the web browser to deliver interactive
   experience for your users such as displaying data from your backend program
   and allow users to submit data to your backend program.

Connecting both of worlds (backend & frontend) is a security critical, very
complex and error prone. You need to understand underlying technology first in
order to connect bot of worlds. Hence there is a full stack web framework that
you can use to build a web application, so you can focus on building the best
web apps.

Full Stack Web Framework is a results of years of doing secure web application
development and bundled into easy-to-use framework that anyone can learn and
use.
