[Remix][1] is a full stack web framework that helps you to write complete web
application from backend to frontend. Backend is a program that run in the
server and frontend is a program that runs in the web browser.

As a web application developer, you need to write two programs:

1. **Backend program** that runs in the server to handle all business logic
   such as user authentication, user authorization and user data management in
   your web application
2. **Frontend program** that runs in the web browser to deliver interactive
   experience for your users such as displaying data from your backend program
   and allow users to submit data to your backend program.

Connecting both of worlds (backend & frontend) is a security critical, very
complex and error prone. Hence there is a full stack web framework like Remix
that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards
to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.

The nice thing about Remix is that you can use one programming language which
is a TypeScript to write code for the backend and frontend.
