Scala is my first functional programming language. Recently I wrote a lot of
codes in Scala to build a Data processing/analytics and Machine Learning
application using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org).

Looking at source code like this:

```scala
val lineWithSaleStock = textFile.filter(line => line.contains("Sale Stock"))
```

My first impression was: "Where the hell is `line` coming from?". At previous
line, there is no definition of `line` variable/value at all.

I decided to look at
[Spark API](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD)
and found the following `filter` method definition:

```txt
def filter(f: (T) â‡’ Boolean): RDD[T]
    Return a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate.
```

It turns out that `filter` method took an argument of boolean function. So,
this part should be a boolean function then:

```scala
line => line.contains("Sale Stock")
```

Ahh interesting, `line` is the input parameters and it returns a boolean value
from `line.contains("Sale Stock")` one. And that's part is a
[Scala Anonymous Function](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/anonymous-function-syntax.html).

It seems, Scala is have a nice syntax to express the anonymous function. I can
express previous function as:

```scala
val isContainsSaleStock = (s: String) => s.contains("Sale Stock")
val lineWithSaleStock = textFile.filter(isContainSaleStock)
```

This
[post](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/anonymous-function-syntax.html)
from Scala Doc provides good resources about Scala anonymous function.
