Lately, I've been thinking about consistency in C programming language API.
Honestly, for me [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org) is very well
designed. Not to mention that a bunch of smart peoples are behind it.

I like Go interface, I like how to Go handle an error, awesome standart
libraries, awesome communities, etc. I would like to write in C and feels like
to write Go code. Can I have it?

Right now, I have an idea to create an simple, consistent, and high-level C
programming language API. I called it "Supreme C". In case you curious,
"Supreme C" I take from
[Supreme Chancellor](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Supreme_Chancellor) name.

I would like to have an API that handle a low level stuff for netoworking, so I
can use a function like `connect("localhost:8080")` and socket file descriptor
ready to read and write is returned.

I want to write and read buffer safely. So, using `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`
concept from Go programming language is a good idea.

Maybe I will start building Supreme C from the problem that I need to solve.
But, I already have the big picture. Supreme C will look like a standart Go
library.
