    My Favorite Logging Format For Training a Machine Learning Models. Why
    this is my favorite.

```python
import logging

LOG_FORMAT = "%(asctime)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='training.log',
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format=LOG_FORMAT
)
```

Why this is my favorite:

1. `%(asctime)s` helps me keep track of the time. I need to know when I run the
   training script and when the model is generated. This is very helpful if you
   are working with many projects/model.
2. `%(filename)s:%(lineno)d` this is very helpful when you are working with GPU
   stuff. Sometimes your training script just blow up and give you this most
   hated error message: `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`. The information of
   last executed file and line number will recorded here. So you donâ€™t need to
   spend an hour of debugging.

If you are curious how the segfault looks like:

```shell
% THEANO_FLAGS=device=cuda0 python main.py
Using cuDNN version 6020 on context None
Mapped name None to device cuda0: GeForce GTX 1070 (0000:22:00.0)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

So clueless right?

Here some output from the logger using the logging format above:
