First of all congratulations and thank you to everyone who worked all this time
to make the merge happen. Welcome to the future of Ethereum. There's no better
place to be.

**Fun fact**: The first Ethereum PoS block already registered as ens domains
15537394.eth

After Bitcoin's whitepaper release, Ethereum's merge is the most consequential
event in crypto's history.

It happens in less than 24 hrs!
