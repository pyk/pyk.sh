It’s always end up doing nothing.

Ideas on my head is like a ton of plankton in the sea. it’s always pop up when
i need it, i feel like it’s always a good idea and start executing it.

Then a giant blue whale comes and eats those plankton as well as my fear about
failure, a feeling that it’s hard to execute, a feeling that i can’t execute in
a right way, a perfectionism that kill my ideas before it born in a real word.

And the notion of "next idea is a good idea" is like an excuse to stop execute
the idea before that. it’s always begin like that and end up like that. I
always end up doing nothing.

I remember some words in this book. it say like this

To much time can only teach you what can go wrong, not what could be
transformative

i guess because i tweet this a month ago, it make this words stay on my head.
and this words start make sense now.
